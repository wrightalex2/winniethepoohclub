<h1>Our Happy Bear</h1>
<p>Winnie the Pooh woke up one day, and he didn't quite feel himself. He didn't feel like such a happy bear. This even made him skip his stretches for the day.<br>
He went outside and Piglet was right there waiting for him. "I'll grab you some honey!" Piglet said aggressively. "I'll get it right now!" And he charged off into the
distance, leapt up to a beehiv, slammed it down to the ground, and took out it's honey. "Here you go, Pooh!"<br>
 Pooh took the honey, but for some reason he was still not a happy bear. This was when Eeeyore showed up. "Top of the mornin' to ya," Eeyore said cheerfully.<br>
  "Piglet is so brave and Eeyore is so cheerful," Pooh said to himself. "Things are not the way they were."<br>
  That was when Rabbit showed up and offered everyone carrots. "They're fresh!" he said kindly. "Just plucked from the garden!"<br>
  "I hope you're having a good day, Rabbit," Eeyore said with a smile. "The weather is lovely."<br>
   "Oh, bother," Pooh said, tapping his head in thought.<br>
    "Let's go on an adventure!" Piglet said furiously. "Let's travel the Hundred Acre Wood and find all its secrets!"<br>
    Christopher Robin showed up next, pushed Winnie the Pooh to the floor, and laughed. "What fun!" Christopher Robin said maniaclly.<br>
    "Oh, bother," Pooh said again, lying on the floor. "I am not a happy bear." <br>
    "Who else can I push around? Who's next?" Christopher Robin said with a grin.<br>
    "I'll take you on!" Piglet said, jumping toward him. Christopher jumped toward Piglet, and the fight began.<br>
    "This is all wrong," Winnie the Pooh said saidly, the least happy bear in all the woods.<br>
    "What's all wrong, buddy?" Rabbit said, putting an arm around Pooh's shoulder.<br>
    "Everything," Pooh said.<br>
    "Everything feels right to me!" Eeyore said.<br>
    "That's the problem," Pooh said.
