     includes three exciting stories. The first is a short story called "Piglet Gets Cold." This is a story about Piglet becoming dreadfully cold 
    and needing his friends help to solve the problem. The second is a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q5G56XF">"Winnie the Pooh and the Storm."</a> In this story, Winnie the Pooh
    and his friends get taken up by a raging storm and thrown into a far off place, away from the Hundred Acre Wood. 
    The final story is called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QFNQ8T8A">"A Brief History of Winnie the Pooh,"</a> a telling of Winnie the Pooh's beginnings and its 
     subsequent rise to fame. Each story can also be bought separately (except for "Piglet Gets Cold"). To learn more, click each title!</p>
