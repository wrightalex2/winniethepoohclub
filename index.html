    <p style="font-family:chewy, Times New Romam, serif; font-size:20px";>Welcome to our official website for new Winnie the Pooh
     stories! Our current selection includes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QGWXQH4">Winnie the Pooh: A Story, A Book, and a 
     History</a>, which is a single book that includes three exciting stories. The first is a short story called "Piglet Gets Cold." This is a story about Piglet becoming dreadfully 
     cold and needing his friends help to solve the problem. The second is a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q5G56XF">"Winnie the Pooh and the Storm."</a> 
     In this story, Winnie the Pooh and his friends get taken up by a raging storm and thrown into a far off place, away from the Hundred Acre Wood. 
     The final story is called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QFNQ8T8A">"A Brief History of Winnie the Pooh,"</a> a telling of Winnie the Pooh's beginnings and its 
     subsequent rise to fame. Each story can also be bought separately (except for "Piglet Gets Cold"). To learn more, click each title!</p> <center>
